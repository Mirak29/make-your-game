            <h2>Prologue</h2>
            <p id="para1" style="display: none;">In a distant world, where darkness threatens to engulf everything, a
                humble smiley stands as the last bastion against chaos. Nicknamed "Bomby", this courageous little hero
                possesses a unique talent: the ability to place bombs. However, his destiny far exceeds his modest
                appearance. Driven by unwavering determination and guided by an innate sense of duty, Bomby ventures
                bravely into lands infested with spectres, determined to exterminate them and restore peace to his
                beloved world.</p>
            <p id="para2" style="display: none;">Created by the forces of darkness themselves, spectres are malevolent
                entities that threaten to plunge the world into eternal darkness. Their mere presence is enough to sow
                terror among the inhabitants, forcing them to live in fear and uncertainty. But Bomby is not one to back
                down from adversity. Armed with his courage and explosive bombs, he plunges headlong into battle,
                determined to eradicate every spectre in his path.</p>
            <p id="para3" style="display: none;">And so begins the epic of Bomby, a perilous journey through lands
                ravaged by evil. Each bomb explosion is a step closer to victory, each defeated spectre a glimmer of
                hope for a better future. With each obstacle overcome, Bomby draws nearer to his ultimate goal: to save
                his world from the shadow that threatens it. His story will become legend, and his courage will
                illuminate the hearts of all who hear it.</p>
